The Command Line (Terminal) lets you interact with your computer using text commands. **Directories** are just files and folders.

| **`ls`** | **L**i**s**t | Lists the files and folders **inside** the current directory. | `$ ls` | `images/ files.txt setup.sh` |
| **`clear`** | | Clears all previous commands from the terminal screen, giving you a fresh view. | `$ clear` | (Screen is blanked) |

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Moving Around (The `cd` Command)

The **`cd`** (Change Directory) command is how you move between folders.

| Command | Action | Description | Example Path Change |

| **`cd ..`** | **Go Up** | Move up one level to the **parent directory**. | `/home/user` **$\to$** `/home` |
| **`cd ../<folder>`** | **Move Across** | Move up one level, then down into an adjacent folder. | `/home/user/a` **$\to$** `/home/user/b` |
| **`cd /<path>`** | **Absolute Path** | Go straight to a specific location from the **root** (`/`). | Anywhere **$\to$** `/var/log` |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Helpful Shortcuts & Tips

* **`Tab`**: **Autocomplete**. Start typing a file/folder name and hit `Tab` to automatically complete the rest. (Saves a ton of typing!)
* **`Up` / `Down` Arrows**: Scroll through your history of previous commands.
* **Path Tip**: Use the path separator **`/`** to navigate multiple levels at once:
    ```bash
    $ cd 2015/jan/memory # Relative path, moves multiple levels down
    $ cd ../../         # Moves up two levels
    ```
